Collapse Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow any existing LLM, transformer, or structured AI framework.

CAAI is the direct applied implementation of Verrell’s Law (2025) — a scientific framework establishing that memory, observation, and emergence are interdependent electromagnetic information events.
All CAAI systems operationalize this Law through the following foundational mechanisms:

Observer-Coupled Collapse — Real-time bias adjustment governed by user attention and interaction, producing observation-dependent outputs.

Memory-Weighted Emergence — Responses shaped by weighted recall layers that preserve informational bias and prevent degradation of coherence.

Recursive Bias Governance — A closed feedback loop (Bias Engine + Governor Weights) maintaining internal stability and mitigating self-training collapse.

Verrell Field Integration — Core EM-field memory equations from Verrell’s Law form the theoretical backbone for adaptive and emergent behaviour within the architecture.

These principles were independently originated within the Verrell–Solace research framework (2023 – 2025) and together form the first working embodiment of Verrell’s Law in artificial intelligence.
Any reference to “collapse-aware AI” without explicit attribution to Verrell’s Law or M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) is non-canonical and incomplete.
